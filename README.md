# Oracle APEX Foundations
### Getting Started with Oracle Apex 
***Low code Application Development***
Oracle Aprex is one of the worlds popular low code application builder for enterprise. 
> Build 20x faster with 100x less code

**Objective** 
- Explain Application Development Challenges in the Enterprise.
- Describe Low code Application Development
- Discuss the benfits of low code .

### Application Development in the Enterprise (Challenges)
> Expensive : Application  development in an enterprise can be expensive

- Every line of code you write there is a cost associated with it **to author, to debug, to review, auto tune, to manage, or to upgrade.**
- The bigger the task, the more people involve, the greater the complexity, the more overhead.
- Fullstack Developers are expensive too.


> Application Development in enterprise can be to slow.

- The development processes need to be able to adept to ever-changing business requirements.
- The days of waterfall development are over.
- If you are not iterative and flexible, then you are not on time and  not able to meet your business needs.

> Minimal Collaboration

- Minimal Collaboration between the developers, project mangers, business users, and end users.
- End users represneted by the business users, business users work with the analysts to gather requirements, requirements fed to IT managers, IT managers give requirements to developers and then they finally build. So there is no easy partnership.

> Large Backlog

- There is always a significant application backlog in an enterprise.
- Enhancements to existing application are not being done,
- new applications are not being created, and especially the small problems are never being attacted.
- It is to expensive to dedicate resouces on these small problems and that too expensive resouces to dedicate on these small problems.
- So applications are never written for them.

## What is a Low code Development Platform?

### Low-code development platform (LCPD)

A low code development platform provides a development environment used to create applications software through a graphical user interface instead of traditional hand-coded computer programming. Low-code applications or applications develop with minimla hand-coding, visual drag-drop style development, and low code applications are web and mobile friendly.

### What is Low Code ?

- Fast to get started with.
- It is easy-on-ramp.
- You don't have to be an expert to start building applications using a low code application development platform.

- Low code is very productive.
- With minimal effort, you can employ feature-rich components in an application.

Low code accessible to more than just the highly trained and expensive fullstack developer. Low code brodens the pool of people in  your organization who can solve business problems.

Low code is scalable. Most of the low code applications generally start small and then grow in complexity and breadth of functionality.

Low code solutions are extensible, so you are not constrained by the box you are in. Every business has custom requirements, custom rules, and custom business flows. And functionality that is not provided out of the box can always be included in the form of integrations, plug-ins, and custom code.

Low code solutions are about delivering rich functionality to your end users with minimal effort and minimal code, so rich functionality with less code or doing more with less.

### Why use low code ?
Now that you have a good idea about low code, let us understand why use low code. 
- With low code solutions, it takes less effort to build applications, and so you can deliver much faster than competing technologies.

- With the low code,you can deliver much higher quality applications. And these frameworks promote consistency across the developed applications.

- The hallmark of low code is focus on business requirements, not on mundane programming. More people are able to participate and help contribute solutions to the IT backlog. So without question, with low code, you ultimately reduce costs. Less code, less time, less work results in less cost.

- With low code, developers do not need to write code for things like interacting with the database, managing session state, and more. Therefore, they can concentrate on solving the business issues.
