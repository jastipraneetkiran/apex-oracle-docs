With Oracle APEX, you can rapidly develop, customize, and deliver solutions. Oracle APEX engine takes care of all of
the low-level plumbing and provides a simple-to-use declarative framework so developers can concentrate on
solving business requirements rather than spending time in writing hundreds of thousands of lines of code to build
applications.

- APEX provides all the necessary pre-built controls to build an application that securely access a database, manages
user credentials, complex business rules, session state and more.
- So with APEX, you can go from prototype to production in just minutes. Rather than modifying lines of code, you can simply update the application definition,
and then run it to see the changes. There is no need to check in code or generate deliverables, just code test, run, and
repeat.

### Oracle APEX is Available Everywhere

Oracle APEX is a fully supported, no-cost feature of Oracle Autonomous Database and all Oracle database
distributions and additions. This means if you have Oracle database, you already have Oracle APEX. This also means
that you have need to access to all of the Oracle database capabilities.

APEX runs anywhere that Oracle database runs, whether it is 
- on premises
- Oracle Cloud
- anywhere else.

And you can deploy your Oracle APEX applications across any environment with ease. In Oracle Cloud, APEX is offered as
a simple all-inclusive a service with all database cloud services, including Autonomous Database, and is also available
as always free with APEX service and Autonomous Database.

### Oracle Autonoums Database  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5713a8d6-63e8-4dde-88e7-dcffc92cf30e)

- Oracle Cloud infrastructure's Autonomous Database is a fully managed, preconfigured database environment. Oracle
Autonomous Database uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to automate many data management tasks
performed by DBAs, including managing database backups, security, and performance tuning. Autonomous
Database offers four different workload types.

1. Autonomous Transaction processing, this is built for transactional workloads and offer high concurrency for short
run inquiries and transactions.
2. Autonomous Data Warehouse, this is built for decision support and data warehouse workloads. It offers fast queries over large volumes of data.
3. Oracle APEX Application Development or APEX service, which is optimized for application developers who want a transaction processing database for application
development using Oracle APEX.
4. Autonomous JSON database, which is built for JSON-centric application development, it offers developer friendly
document APIs and native JSON storage.

- You can use the Oracle APEX service with each of the other workload types.

Autonomous database can be used without charge as part of the Oracle Cloud infrastructure's suite of all these free
resources.

Oracle APEX plus Autonomous Database on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is a powerful combination. Oracle APEX on
Autonomous Database provides a pre-configured, fully managed, and secured environment to both develop and
deploy world class applications.

Oracle takes care of configuration, tuning, backups, patching, encryption, scaling,
and more, leaving you free to focus on solving your business problems.

The Autonomous Database cloud services also include powerful technologies, such as Oracle REST data services and
database actions to access, manage, and maintain your data. 

### Oracle Apex Application Development Service.
**Easy to use,fully managed,enterprise-class service on Oracle Cloud**

The world's most popular enterprise low code application development platform, Oracle APEX, along with the world's best converged database, Oracle Autonomous
Database, on the world's best cloud infrastructure.

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is available as a simple, all-inclusive cloud service that scales as you grow. All inclusive
also means you are not constrained by additional costs that can impact the success and popularity of your
applications.

The Oracle APEX Application Development Service or APEX Service is the fastest lowest cost way to develop and
deploy world class applications. Your APEX service can be ready in just a few minutes, and you will never have to
worry about the complexity of mid tiers, load balances, encryption, and more. APEX Service simplifies costs that are
typically associated with other low code platforms.


- There is no complex pricing associated with the number of users, developers, or applications within your APEX
service.
- There are also no limits on the number of applications that can be developed, the number of developers
using the service, or the number of end users using your applications.
- There are also no additional fee for data transfer into or out of your service.
- You can utilize Oracle REST data services(ORDS) to create custom REST APIs against your
application data and use database actions to compose SQL queries and graphically model data.

## Orcle APEX Architecture
Now is the time to learn Oracle APEX architecture. Oracle APEX uses a simple three-tier architecture where requests
are sent from the browser through a web server to the database. All processing, data manipulation, and business
logic is executed within the database. This architecture guarantees zero latency data access, top performance, and
scalability out of the box.

A web request from the web browser is sent to Oracle REST data services where it is handed to Oracle database to be
action. Within the database, the request is processed by Oracle APEX. Once the processing is complete, the result is
sent back through Oracle REST data services to the browser. When you create or extend an application, APEX creates
or modifies the metadata stored in the database tables.

When the application is run, the APEX engine then reads the metadata and displays the requested page or processes
page submissions. There is no need for file-based compilation, and there is no code generation at all. All processing
is performed by SQL acting directly on the data schemes in the database. Therefore, Oracle APEX applications are
very efficient as data is manipulated directly in the database, and the results are sent back to your web browser.

A single API call invokes all of the necessary data processing based on the metadata definition in a single request
rather than requiring multiple calls to the database. Oracle REST Data Services, Autonomous Database, and APEX are
available, fully managed with Oracle Autonomous Cloud Services.

## Deploy Wherever Oracle Database Runs

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3557c33-d747-4b7a-a820-f46456f8c9ee)

You can deploy Oracle APEX applications wherever Oracle database runs. APEX enables you to seamlessly shift
applications to and from the Oracle Database Cloud Service, private and public clouds, on premise, and even the free
public evaluation service. For example, you can develop an APEX application running on Windows on premises and
deploy it to Oracle APEX running in the Cloud on Linux or vice versa.
