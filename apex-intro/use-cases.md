### What does Oracle APEX do for you?


Let us first try to understand what does APEX do for you. APEX minimizes the
complexity involved with multifaceted applications and provides developers with the features they need to solve
business problems without needing to become experts in vast web technologies.

User interface, universal theme is a user interface for APEX that enables developers to build modern web applications
without requiring extensive knowledge of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. With just some basic knowledge of APEX, you
can use universal theme to easily build a responsive application that is highly accessible, easily customizable, and
easy to maintain data.

APEX strives to make it as easy as possible for you to display, manipulate, chart, and process data as easily and
efficiently as possible. No matter where your data comes from, whether it is from a local database, a remote database,
or a web service, APEX features state of the art functionality to help you turn data into information.

Visualization, with APEX, you can enjoy powerful chart and visualization capabilities powered by Oracle JET. You can
easily add beautiful, fast, highly customizable, accessible, and extremely versatile charts to your applications with
ease. Security, APEX is designed to build web applications that are highly secure out of the box. In a world of
constantly changing web standards and increasingly resourceful attackers finding new ways to hack sites, APEX focus
on security means that your applications stay protected.

Globalization, globalization is the ability of a development framework to support developing applications that
perform well and correctly in multiple languages and local environments. APEX is designed with globalization in
mind. This includes support for translating applications as well as localization. That is adapting an application to
support a specific language and local.

Monitoring, monitoring and logging provide insight into how users interact with your application. This information
can be indispensable in identify hacking attempts, performance issues, and application errors. With APEX, you're
completely covered because monitoring and logging are already built in.

Now, let us learn what is Oracle APEX used for. Oracle APEX provides compelling solutions for a variety of use cases,
whether it is a simple spreadsheet replacement or a mission-critical enterprise system used by thousands on a daily
basis. One of the primary use cases of APEX is to replace spreadsheets used for business critical functions.

Using the wizard in Apex and just a few clicks, you can transform your spreadsheet into your fully populated table in
Oracle database and then complete with the fully functioning application with a report and form for maintaining the
data. You can just drag and drop an XLS, CSV, XML, or JSON file and convert that into a beautiful responsive and
secure APEX application in minutes.

Instead of having any number of spreadsheets floating around, you can build a single source-of-truth. Users log into
APEX to access a single centralized application where everyone maintains the data and everyone always sees the
same data. And instead of sending a file, you just send the URL to the end users. Spreadsheets generally lack
authentication and auditing capabilities. APEX applications can utilize single sign-on, LDAP, or social signing, and can
readily incorporate audit tracking. Once you build this application, you can extend this application with charts,
calendars, validations, and more.

One of the major use cases of APEX is to build applications required immediately to meet a new business
opportunity. Organizations have a huge backlog of applications they're required to meet every changing business
need and to stay competitive. These are generally not enterprise applications and may only be required for a limited
time. The requirements may be poorly defined and the business priorities may change rapidly, which is why the
applications must be very fast to build and easy to update as required. An APEX is a best fit for such requirements.

Using the powerful reserves in Apex, you can build applications in days or weeks. You can create a fully featured
application in minutes. You can easily work with end users and implement changes and enhancement requests often
in real-time. APEX is just as fast at maintaining and enhancing existing applications as it is to build the first prototype.
IT professionals, as well as tech savvy business users can use the low code capabilities within Oracle APEX to quickly
build applications. The powerful components of Oracle APEX enable you to add a high level of functionality to your
applications with limited coding.

With APEX, you can build solutions rapidly with just one or two people. You can go from concept to working
prototype in just minutes. You can build simplistic and tactical applications for diverse use cases with minimal to no
coding. Oracle APEX is the clear platform of choice for easily transitioning Oracle forms applications to modern web
applications. The same stored procedures and PL/SQL packages work natively in APEX, making it a breeze to
develop.

Oracle forms applications often provide an out of date client server user experience, may have poor usability and
accessibility issues, have difficulties working with various browsers, and are not mobile friendly. It's often difficult and
cost prohibitive to hire skilled Oracle forms developers. As Oracle APEX and Oracle forms are both SQL and PL/SQL
based and provide declarative development environments, it is easy for developers to transition from Oracle forms to
Oracle APEX.

You can build proof of concept using subset of forms applications. And you can build organization-wide applications
rather than back office applications. With a universal theme in Apex, you can build modern, beautiful web based
external applications for customers and partners. Running an APEX application is 100% browser based and requires
no client software. The applications are fully responsive, making them mobile-ready by default, which means you can
run in your browser or any device. For Net new requirements or major functional upgrades, it is best to consider
APEX as an alternative.

Another major use case of APEX is extending your ERP systems. ERP systems provide extensive functionality out of
the box. However, they don't always provide the specific reports you need or may be missing functionality, especially
if it is specific to your industry or your organization.

You may also find common business processes that take far too many steps to complete making them inefficient. In
such cases, building an extension using APEX can not only fill the gaps, but deliver the appropriate information or
greatly improve productivity and therefore enhance user satisfaction. For example, you can have organization-
specific dashboards, improved workflows, additional reporting to fill the gaps.

Solutions, for example, meeting company or industry-specific requirements by building bespoke applications, such
applications should utilize the appropriate ERP data, but may well have local database objects to store additional data
not available in the ERP system. So with APEX, you can build applications to optimize common business functions,
enhance data capture, and integrate disparate data sources.

APEX can be used to build a wide variety of applications for any industry. From the simplest application that verifies a
spreadsheet to mission critical applications which are used daily by tens of thousands of users. The elegant
architecture of APEX has been used to power thousands of applications around the globe for years.

Obtaining a complete accurate picture across the organization or even within a department is often very challenging.
Data is held numerous systems, existing reports are limited, and don't always provide the required detail to make
informed business decisions. It is hard to limit who can see what and avoid data breaches and running the can
reports can take hours.

Utilizing APEX and its extensive reporting and data visualization capabilities makes developing appropriate
dashboards for various user communities far simpler. You can merge data silos within your APEX application and
build interactive reporting applications based on disparate data.

Applications built using Oracle APEX are enterprise-ready from day one. APEX is unique in that it offers flexibility in
where it can be deployed. You can deploy APEX on premises on the Oracle Cloud, on a private Cloud, or anywhere
else Oracle database runs. Apart from simplified deployment, a single APEX installations runs any number of
applications. There is no limit on the number of applications, number of developers and users.

With APEX, you have direct access to all of the Oracle database, including the enterprise features and capabilities of
the autonomous database. This means that APEX developers can use all of this functionality to build and deploy their
mission-critical enterprise systems in this lesson, you learned about the different facets of application development
that APEX takes care of. You also learned about all APEX use cases. This concludes the lesson on Oracle APEX use
cases. I hope you find it useful. Thank you so much for watching.
